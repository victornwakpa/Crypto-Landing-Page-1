00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,437
[exhaling deeply] Oh, come--

185
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:10,562
- Hey! I'm back!
- [woman] Hi! Welcome back!

186
00:09:10,646 --> 00:09:11,521
- Hi…
- [man] Hello!

187
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:13,687
- [woman] Welcome.
- [man] Ah. There she is!

188
00:09:13,771 --> 00:09:15,437
- Wait, wait. Hold on.
- [man] You hungry?

189
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,187
- [Yusuke slurping]
- Look… Keiko.

190
00:09:17,729 --> 00:09:19,562
- [Keiko] Huh?
- Uh, we're gonna go.

191
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:20,479
Huh? No, but--

192
00:09:20,562 --> 00:09:22,854
I'm sorry. Bye, Keiko!

193
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,021
See ya!

194
00:09:24,104 --> 00:09:25,104
Wait.

195
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,896
[grunting] Huh?

196
00:09:29,146 --> 00:09:32,104
[man 1 laughing]
You're unbelievable as always.

197
00:09:32,187 --> 00:09:33,312
[man 2 laughing]

198
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:35,146
- I'm telling you.
- [man 1 laughing]

199
00:09:35,229 --> 00:09:36,354
Hey, Yusuke!

200
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:37,396
Yeah? What?

201
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:40,812
Today, at school,
you stopped the bullies, right?

202
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:43,187
Why didn't you explain
you were helping another student?

203
00:09:43,271 --> 00:09:45,271
No way. That's too much effort.

204
00:09:45,354 --> 00:09:47,312
Yusuke, why don't you
listen to me for once?

205
00:09:47,396 --> 00:09:49,104
I'm telling you, I'll handle this.

206
00:09:52,562 --> 00:09:53,979
- [slurping]
- Whatever.

207
00:09:54,854 --> 00:09:56,396
All right. Well, I don't care.

208
00:09:58,562 --> 00:10:00,021
Oh, great. That's good.

209
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:02,646
See ya later, detective.

210
00:10:02,729 --> 00:10:03,896
Quit calling me that!

211
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,896
Just go and… Go die!

212
00:10:07,104 --> 00:10:08,104
[door closes]

213
00:10:09,562 --> 00:10:11,562
[children screaming]

214
00:10:13,604 --> 00:10:14,937
[woman] Welcome back.

215

[loud banging]

216
00:10:16,271 --> 00:10:18,104
- [man] Hey, what's that?
- [crashing]

217
00:10:18,187 --> 00:10:19,979
[people shouting, screaming]

00:10:39,062 --> 00:10:41,062
[screaming]

224
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:43,646
- [people continue screaming]
- [music continues]

225
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:46,979
[engine revving]

226
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:50,604
[brakes squealing]

227
00:10:53,979 --> 00:10:56,312
[theme music playing]

228
00:11:00,896 --> 00:11:01,979
[narrator] <i>Long ago,</i>

229
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:04,812
<i>the Human World and Demon World</i>
<i>were connected.</i>

230
00:11:05,854 --> 00:11:09,646
<i>Humans who wandered into the Demon World</i>
<i>were attacked by yokai,</i>

231
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:13,271
<i>while yokai crept into the Human World</i>
<i>to prey on humans.</i>

232
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:17,771
<i>Later, the Spirit World drew a boundary</i>
<i>between the two,</i>

233
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:21,062
<i>separating the Human World</i>
<i>from the Demon World.</i>

234
00:11:24,562 --> 00:11:27,687
<i>- Or at least, that was the plan.</i>
- [man 1] Let's bring him down.

235
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,812
- Nice and easy.
- [fluttering]

236
00:11:30,896 --> 00:11:32,896
[siren wailing]

237
00:11:32,979 --> 00:11:35,396
[man 2] Okay! Cleared! Okay, all cleared!

238
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:37,104
Yes! You understand? You got it?

239
00:11:37,187 --> 00:11:39,271
Wow. Looks like I'm a ghost now.

240
00:11:40,646 --> 00:11:43,646
How impressive! Kids these days
are pretty quick to catch on.

241
00:11:43,729 --> 00:11:44,937
[man] Check the parameter.

242
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:49,146
A lot of victims of accidents can't accept
that they are in the afterlife now.

243
00:11:49,229 --> 00:11:52,146
So, this is enough evidence
to convince you of that. Right?

244
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:53,562
[man] Coming through!

245
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:54,771
Who would you be?

246
00:11:55,354 --> 00:11:57,396
Think of me as your guide.

247
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:58,937
Botan at your service.

248
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:00,771
They say "Grim Reaper" in the West.

249
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:02,187
I have many titles.

250
00:12:02,271 --> 00:12:04,687
- Greetings!
- Screw your greetings! This is crazy!

251
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:07,729
- I guess you're still feeling bad, right?
- Yeah! Obviously!

252
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:10,187
I'm in shock. Can't you tell?

253
00:12:10,854 --> 00:12:13,479
Why don't you get that smile
off your face, you little punk?

254
00:12:13,562 --> 00:12:15,979
Oh. Of course.

255
00:12:16,062 --> 00:12:18,229
Yes, your personality matches the data.

256
00:12:18,896 --> 00:12:20,979
Urameshi, 17 years old.

257
00:12:21,062 --> 00:12:22,562
First name, Yusuke.

258
00:12:22,646 --> 00:12:24,187
Rough, violent, and reckless.

259
00:12:24,271 --> 00:12:27,521
<i>- Shut it!</i>
- Not very intelligent and Ill-tempered.

260
00:12:27,604 --> 00:12:30,187
Fighting, drinking, gambling…

261
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:33,187
- [gasps] Quite a reputation.
<i>- You got a complaint?</i>

262
00:12:33,271 --> 00:12:35,812
- It might be a good thing you died.
<i>- You wanna fight, scumbag?</i>

263
00:12:35,896 --> 00:12:37,937
'Cause it sounds like you're really evil.

264
00:12:38,021 --> 00:12:39,396
[Yusuke] Shut up! Leave me alone!

265
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:41,854
[Botan] Where are you going?
I haven't finished.

266
00:12:43,104 --> 00:12:45,187
[doctor] His forehead and hands
are a little grazed,

267
00:12:45,271 --> 00:12:48,146
but there are no fractures,
and his brain is completely fine.

268
00:12:48,229 --> 00:12:50,021
[sighs] Oh, thank goodness!

269
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:52,521
Isn't that great, Masaru?

270
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:54,896
So that means there's no need
for him to be hospitalized.

271
00:12:54,979 --> 00:12:56,187
He can go home today.

272
00:12:56,271 --> 00:12:57,562
Okay. Uh…

273
00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:02,229
Doctor, can you tell us what happened
to that student who saved my son?

274
00:13:03,604 --> 00:13:04,646
[sighs]

275
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:08,604
I guess… [sighing]

276
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:10,104
…that's enough.

277
00:13:12,604 --> 00:13:13,937
Botan, is that right?

278
00:13:14,646 --> 00:13:15,479
[inhales deeply]

279
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,104
You can take me away now.

280
00:13:17,604 --> 00:13:19,021
To hell, or wherever.

281
00:13:19,604 --> 00:13:20,854
[inhales, groans]

282
00:13:20,937 --> 00:13:22,562
[chuckles]

283
00:13:22,646 --> 00:13:25,187
You know, appearances can be deceiving.

284
00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:27,896
I don't think you understand.

285
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:31,521
I'm not bringing you to hell
or anywhere for that matter.

286
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:34,437
Huh? What are you saying?

287
00:13:34,521 --> 00:13:35,771
To tell you the truth,

288
00:13:35,854 --> 00:13:38,396
your death was not anticipated
by the Spirit World.

289
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:41,312
Nobody could have ever imagined
a hoodlum like you

290
00:13:41,396 --> 00:13:44,854
would have sacrificed himself
in order to save a child.

291
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:46,396
Oddities like this are very rare.

292
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:47,854
Did you say odd?

293
00:13:48,437 --> 00:13:51,729
There are important things
that we still have to discuss, Yusuke.

294
00:13:51,812 --> 00:13:54,562
But first we have to get you
to the Spirit World.

295
00:13:54,646 --> 00:13:56,896
Don't worry.
My boss will explain everything.

296
00:13:58,521 --> 00:14:00,479
- We're leaving?
- [Botan] Yes.

297
00:14:01,104 --> 00:14:02,229
Right now.

298
00:14:04,146 --> 00:14:05,729
Wh-- What is this?

299
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:09,312
[Botan] The Spirit World is on
a higher plane than the third dimension.

300
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:11,437
I don't understand.

301
00:14:12,021 --> 00:14:15,146
Just think of it as a mysterious world.

302
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,146
[ethereal music playing]

303
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:18,104
[Yusuke grunts]

304

[ethereal music continues]

305
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:40,104
See there? That's where the boss is.

306
00:14:41,312 --> 00:14:43,896
Tell me,
who exactly is this boss of yours?

307
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:46,396
My boss is Enma, of course.

308
00:14:47,979 --> 00:14:50,187
Wha-- Really? Enma?

309
00:14:52,271 --> 00:14:53,687
How about that.

310
00:14:53,771 --> 00:14:56,062
[ethereal music continues]

311
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,604

315
00:15:27,146 --> 00:15:28,146
<i>Thanks.</i>

316
00:15:28,812 --> 00:15:29,687
<i>Does it hurt?</i>

317
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:31,521
<i>No.</i>

318
00:15:31,604 --> 00:15:33,021
<i>Thank you.</i>

319
00:15:33,104 --> 00:15:34,312
[man] <i>Here you go.</i>

320
00:15:34,396 --> 00:15:35,562
<i>Thank you.</i>

321
00:15:35,646 --> 00:15:39,271
<i>In that case, thank you.</i>
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

322
00:15:40,771 --> 00:15:41,854
[man] <i>Are you okay?</i>

323
00:15:41,937 --> 00:15:43,062
<i>- Thank you.</i>
- [man] <i>Not at all.</i>

324
00:15:43,146 --> 00:15:44,896
<i>Thank you so much. Thank you very much.</i>

325
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:46,687

[whooshing]

328
00:15:55,396 --> 00:15:56,271
Hi there.

329
00:15:56,354 --> 00:15:58,771
- I brought Yusuke Urameshi.
- [Enma] Ah.

330
00:15:59,396 --> 00:16:01,104
I'm almost done. Give me a minute.

331
00:16:01,187 --> 00:16:03,479
- [man] <i>Come back, you damn kids!</i>
<i>- Shut up, you old dinosaur!</i>

332
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,021
- [boy 1] <i>Run, quickly!</i>
- [boy 2] <i>Quickly, go!</i>

333
00:16:06,104 --> 00:16:07,312
[man] <i>You little brats!</i>

334
00:16:07,396 --> 00:16:08,604
What's he doing?

335
00:16:09,187 --> 00:16:12,937
[Botan] He's dividing the souls
of the dead between heaven and hell.

336
00:16:13,021 --> 00:16:13,854
[man] <i>Give me that!</i>

337
00:16:13,937 --> 00:16:17,104
[Yusuke] Wow. The process
sure is different from what I've heard.

338
00:16:17,646 --> 00:16:19,354
[Botan] The process has changed a lot.

339
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,854
See, over the years, we've worked hard
to increase efficiency in how we work.

340
00:16:23,937 --> 00:16:25,979
[man] <i>Dammit! </i>[yelling]

00:16:33,646 --> 00:16:34,729
[Enma] How do you do?

344
00:16:36,104 --> 00:16:37,187
Welcome.

345
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:41,854
You're

346
00:16:42,437 --> 00:16:43,271
Enma?

347
00:16:43,354 --> 00:16:46,604
I am King Enma Jr., also known as Koenma.

348
00:16:46,687 --> 00:16:48,229
So you need to watch your tongue.

349
00:16:48,312 --> 00:16:49,437
What was that?

350
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:51,021
No! [shushing]

351
00:16:51,104 --> 00:16:52,146
Never mind.

352
00:16:52,229 --> 00:16:53,271
[inhales deeply]

353
00:16:53,354 --> 00:16:55,687
As you can see, I'm so busy I could die.

354
00:16:55,771 --> 00:16:57,396
So, I'll cut to the chase.

355
00:16:59,229 --> 00:17:01,354
Listen up, Yusuke Urameshi.

356
00:17:04,562 --> 00:17:05,771
I'm resurrecting you.

357
00:17:07,854 --> 00:17:10,396
In exchange,
you'll work as a Spirit Detective.

358
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:13,104
And what's that?

359
00:17:13,812 --> 00:17:16,937
Well, you'll be solving cases
involving yokai

360
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:18,771
that have invaded the Human World.

361
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:23,062
That role has been vacant
for quite a while now, unfortunately.

362
00:17:24,896 --> 00:17:26,604
And there's trouble in the world.

363
00:17:29,604 --> 00:17:31,604
[rumbling]

364
00:17:39,646 --> 00:17:42,312
This is a yokai
called a roundworm monster.

365
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,521
They usually inhabit the Demon World,

366
00:17:45,604 --> 00:17:47,854
but they seem
to have entered the Human World.

367
00:17:49,187 --> 00:17:53,437
Find out why the roundworm monster
has appeared in the Human World.

368
00:17:55,437 --> 00:17:57,937
And you'll be alive again.
That's incentive enough.

369
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:00,021
[pensive music playing]

370
00:18:04,146 --> 00:18:04,979
No, thanks.

371
00:18:05,979 --> 00:18:06,812
Huh?

372
00:18:06,896 --> 00:18:10,437
Huh? You're getting a second chance.
Why would you refuse that?

373
00:18:10,521 --> 00:18:12,562
I don't like being told what to do.

374
00:18:14,396 --> 00:18:18,479
Plus, everyone will be relieved
that Yusuke's dead.

375
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:23,021
See ya.

376
00:18:23,104 --> 00:18:24,396
[somber music playing]

377
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:27,062
Wa-- Wait a minute now.

378
00:18:32,562 --> 00:18:33,396
[Enma] Huh?

379
00:18:34,271 --> 00:18:36,562
[somber music playing]

380
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,562
[music continues]

381
00:18:54,896 --> 00:18:55,812
[sighs]

382
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:57,896
[wind whooshing]

383
00:19:00,771 --> 00:19:02,771
[intense music playing]

384
00:19:20,854 --> 00:19:22,146
[arcade game machines dinging]

385
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:24,229
- That was fun.
- Mm-hmm.

386
00:19:25,271 --> 00:19:26,729
- Let's try that!
- Yeah!

387
00:19:28,104 --> 00:19:31,146
[intense music continues]

388
00:19:39,062 --> 00:19:40,729
- [dealer] It's a draw!
- [man] Yes!

389
00:19:42,437 --> 00:19:44,937
Tarukane is here at the roulette table.

390
00:19:45,812 --> 00:19:48,104
- This one.
- [woman] Yeah? [chuckles]

391
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,479
Are you enjoying yourself
at my casino, Tarukane?

392
00:19:52,146 --> 00:19:54,312
I've lost 200 million yen.

393
00:19:56,771 --> 00:19:59,687
Why not try putting
everything you have left on 22?

394
00:20:02,396 --> 00:20:03,937
- [dealer] Last call.
- [Tarukane] Hmm.

395
00:20:04,646 --> 00:20:05,562
[bell dings]

396
00:20:07,104 --> 00:20:07,979
[dealer] No more bets.

397
00:20:12,104 --> 00:20:15,104
- Winning number, 22, black. Even.
- Huh?

398
00:20:15,187 --> 00:20:16,646
[woman gasps] Really?

399
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:18,771
- [man] Congratulations.
- [women squeal, laugh]

400
00:20:18,854 --> 00:20:20,229
[Tarukane] Ah.

401
00:20:20,812 --> 00:20:22,562
So it's been rigged, huh?

402
00:20:22,646 --> 00:20:24,062
Of course not.

403
00:20:24,146 --> 00:20:25,812
- [scoffs]
- You don't believe it?

404
00:20:27,146 --> 00:20:30,146
By the way, I heard you're trying
to start a new business

405
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,312
with that sinkhole we sold you.

406
00:20:32,979 --> 00:20:34,104
Yes.

407
00:20:34,187 --> 00:20:35,396
You heard correctly.

408
00:20:36,062 --> 00:20:39,854
You're the only person obsessing
over that big hole in the ground.

409
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:41,062
[scoffs]

410
00:20:41,146 --> 00:20:43,396
Did you find buried treasure down there?

411
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:44,312
No.

412
00:20:44,854 --> 00:20:46,312
No. Something even better.

413
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:47,771
[intriguing music playing]

414
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:51,021
A hole that goes on and on.

415
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:55,354
And it leads right to the Demon World.

416
00:20:56,771 --> 00:20:59,021
[dealer] Paying the winner.
Congratulations, sir!

417
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:01,437
- [women laughing]
- [woman] Congratulations!

418
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:02,979
[man] Whoa! I won!

419
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:10,479
[Botan] You're very sentimental
for a 17-year-old.

420
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,104
[siren wailing in distance]

421
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,437
Botan, please go.

422
00:21:15,187 --> 00:21:17,062
You really don't want to be alive?

423
00:21:21,271 --> 00:21:23,979
I've done this sort of thing
for a while now, Yusuke.

424
00:21:25,146 --> 00:21:27,896
The best way for you to tell
what everyone thinks of the deceased

425
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:30,104
is when they come to pay their respects.

426
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:33,104
Think about what you want to do.

427
00:21:33,812 --> 00:21:35,312
How about we visit your wake?

428
00:21:43,437 --> 00:21:45,979
- [rhythmic drumming]
- [monk chanting]

429
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:19,146
[man] Okay, next!

430
00:22:19,229 --> 00:22:20,354
[indistinct chatter]

431
00:22:20,437 --> 00:22:22,896
- You hungry?
- I'm thinking ramen today.

432
00:22:22,979 --> 00:22:25,771
[boy] Sounds good.
Either that or Chinese soba.

433
00:22:25,854 --> 00:22:28,729
- That's the same thing, right?
- [boys laugh]

434
00:22:29,604 --> 00:22:31,562
- This looks about right.
- [boy 1] Oh!

435
00:22:32,104 --> 00:22:34,271
[boy 2] Kirino! Perfect timing!

436
00:22:41,354 --> 00:22:42,396
What you got there?

437
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,229
- [gasps]
- Hand it over, now.

438
00:22:46,812 --> 00:22:49,562
You're an idiot.
Why would you give cash to some dead guy?

439
00:22:49,646 --> 00:22:50,646
[boys laughing]

440
00:22:50,729 --> 00:22:52,187
Bunch of stupid assholes.

441
00:22:53,396 --> 00:22:54,646
A condolence gift.

442
00:22:54,729 --> 00:22:56,729
[laughing]

443
00:22:57,604 --> 00:22:58,687
- No!
- Oh!

444
00:22:58,771 --> 00:23:01,396
- Easy there! Come on!
- Give it back here!

445
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:02,354
[grunting]

446
00:23:02,437 --> 00:23:04,187
No! Don't! [sobbing]

447
00:23:04,937 --> 00:23:05,979
[grunts]

448
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:08,562
You worthless loser.

449
00:23:08,646 --> 00:23:11,187
Hey! Stop, stop, Kuwabara! This is a wake!

450
00:23:11,271 --> 00:23:12,312
- Stop him! Stop!
- Hey…

451
00:23:12,396 --> 00:23:14,979
- [all grunting]
- Let go! Hey! Let go!

452
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:16,479
[grunting]

453
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,437
Urameshi, you bastard!

454
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:21,562
Dying before our rematch
is a sleazy tactic!

455
00:23:21,646 --> 00:23:22,771
[hyperventilating]

456
00:23:22,854 --> 00:23:24,812
You should still be alive!

457
00:23:24,896 --> 00:23:25,812
Kuwabara!

458
00:23:25,896 --> 00:23:27,146
- Oh, sorry!
- [whimpering]

459
00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:28,812
Please! Just one more round!

460
00:23:28,896 --> 00:23:30,687
Let go! [grunting]

461
00:23:31,437 --> 00:23:32,896
That moron's here too.

462
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:35,729
- [Kuwabara] Let go!
- [friend] Let's just calm him down.

463
00:23:35,812 --> 00:23:36,812
It's okay.

464
00:23:36,896 --> 00:23:38,896
- [rhythmic drumming]
- [chanting]

465
00:23:47,437 --> 00:23:49,979
Thank you for saving my life!

466
00:23:55,812 --> 00:23:56,812
Hey, Mommy.

467
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:59,896
Let's talk to him once he's awake, okay?

468
00:24:00,646 --> 00:24:03,771
Then I can also say thank you
face-to-face! Isn't that right?

469
00:24:03,854 --> 00:24:06,396
- [somber music playing]
- [chanting continues]

470
00:24:11,771 --> 00:24:14,312
[drumming, chanting fades]

471
00:24:14,396 --> 00:24:16,396
[somber music continues]

472
00:24:34,104 --> 00:24:35,729
[woman] We've done this before.

473
00:24:37,687 --> 00:24:38,521
[Keiko] Hmm?

474
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:41,104
You don't recall?

475
00:24:42,312 --> 00:24:43,812
When Yusuke caught a cold.

476
00:24:45,604 --> 00:24:46,812
- Oh…
- [chuckles]

477
00:24:48,646 --> 00:24:51,271
Middle of winter,
my son dives into the river.

478
00:24:52,271 --> 00:24:53,146
[chuckles]

479
00:24:53,854 --> 00:24:56,562
That's right. I remember.
He dove after my hat.

480
00:24:56,646 --> 00:24:57,937
- [chuckles]
- That's right.

481
00:24:59,312 --> 00:25:01,854
That may have been the only time
he caught a cold.

482
00:25:02,396 --> 00:25:04,354
Who could forget something like that?

483
00:25:05,229 --> 00:25:07,396
[laughs] I was so worried that day.

484
00:25:08,729 --> 00:25:09,562
Mmm.

485
00:25:11,437 --> 00:25:12,562
That time, too…

486
00:25:14,437 --> 00:25:16,896
you cared for him and never left his side.

487
00:25:16,979 --> 00:25:17,937
Right, Keiko?

488
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,271
[inhales deeply]

489
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,771
This is my fault, Atsuko.

490
00:25:28,854 --> 00:25:29,771
Atsuko,

491
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:32,062
I…

492
00:25:32,604 --> 00:25:34,812
I was angry at Yusuke that day.

493
00:25:37,187 --> 00:25:39,729
I… I told Yusuke to go die.

494
00:25:40,271 --> 00:25:41,687
[sobbing]

495
00:25:41,771 --> 00:25:43,896
Even though I didn't mean it. Still…

496
00:25:43,979 --> 00:25:45,604
[continues sobbing]

497
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:47,687
It's all my fault.

498
00:25:47,771 --> 00:25:49,187
[sobbing]

499
00:25:50,687 --> 00:25:51,771
I'm sorry!

500
00:25:53,521 --> 00:25:54,771
I'm so sorry.

501
00:25:55,312 --> 00:25:56,562
Atsuko.

502
00:25:57,229 --> 00:25:58,687
Yusuke… [sobbing]

503
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:03,604
[both sobbing]

504
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,229
It's all right.

505
00:26:07,646 --> 00:26:10,979
Don't worry. That kind of thing
wouldn't bother Yusuke.

506
00:26:14,229 --> 00:26:15,979
So don't make that face.

507
00:26:18,062 --> 00:26:19,854
He would hate to see it.

508
00:26:19,937 --> 00:26:22,604
[both sobbing]

509
00:26:33,937 --> 00:26:36,646
He's made two grown women cry in one go.

510
00:26:38,437 --> 00:26:39,687
He's so annoying!

511
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:41,479
[sobbing]

[music ends]

514
00:27:04,604 --> 00:27:06,646
- [boy 1] Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
- [Kirino grunting]

515
00:27:06,729 --> 00:27:07,896
Nice one!

516
00:27:07,979 --> 00:27:09,396
Go, go, go, go!

517
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:11,062
- [boy 1] Oh!
- [boy 2] Go, go, go, go!

- [indistinct chatter and laughter]
- [grunting]

519

[boy 1] Hey!

520
00:27:14,437 --> 00:27:16,062
- [grunting]
- [boy 2] One more!

521
00:27:16,146 --> 00:27:18,437
- [panting]
- [boy 3] Yeah! Get him!

522
00:27:18,521 --> 00:27:20,146
- [panting]
- [boy laughing]

523
00:27:20,229 --> 00:27:21,729
Whoa, hey, hey, hey!

00:47:08,562 --> 00:47:10,937
- [Atsuko sobbing]
- Please. Serious?!

893
00:47:11,021 --> 00:47:12,354
What is this?

894
00:47:12,854 --> 00:47:14,146
I said I get it!

895
00:47:16,062 --> 00:47:18,687
That was a close call in a lot of ways.

896
00:47:18,771 --> 00:47:19,687
[Enma sighs]

897
00:47:20,312 --> 00:47:23,729
If that's how our new
Spirit Detective fights, we're in trouble.

898
00:47:23,812 --> 00:47:24,729
Huh?

899
00:47:25,604 --> 00:47:28,396
From what I've heard,
they're after you-know-what.

900
00:47:30,479 --> 00:47:32,479
[rumbling]

901
00:47:35,104 --> 00:47:37,437
He's gonna have to fight those things?

902
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,646
That's not fair.
Yusuke won't even stand a chance.

903
00:47:40,729 --> 00:47:42,146
I know that.

904
00:47:43,062 --> 00:47:45,437
[sighs] But we have no choice.

905
00:47:46,646 --> 00:47:49,521
We can't let it be used for evil,
no matter what.

906
00:47:49,604 --> 00:47:51,604

[growling in distance]

914
00:48:14,771 --> 00:48:15,687

915

927
00:49:23,312 --> 00:49:24,521
[croaks]

928
00:49:25,146 --> 00:49:26,979
[grunts]

929
00:49:27,062 --> 00:49:29,062
[thrilling music playing]

930
00:49:31,729 --> 00:49:33,229
[frantic snarling]

931
00:49:34,312 --> 00:49:36,646
[rumbling]

932
00:49:37,437 --> 00:49:39,146
[roaring ferociously]

933
00:49:44,021 --> 00:49:45,979
