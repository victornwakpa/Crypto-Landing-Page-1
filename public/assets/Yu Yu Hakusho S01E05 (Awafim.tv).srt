What do you mean?

113
00:05:48,021 --> 00:05:49,854
The hole is expanding too quickly.

114

You bastard.

132
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:02,271
Do you have any idea what you are doing?

133
00:07:03,646 --> 00:07:07,229
By widening that hole,
yokai are going to come swarming through.

134
00:07:08,604 --> 00:07:09,562
That's correct.

135
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:10,771
Don't do this.

136
00:07:11,354 --> 00:07:13,271
Nobody in the city will be safe.

137
00:07:15,396 --> 00:07:17,354
Tell me what you're trying to achieve.

138
00:07:19,896 --> 00:07:21,604
I want to see a larger world.

139
00:07:21,687 --> 00:07:23,104
The way it was

140
00:07:23,771 --> 00:07:27,479
before you separated
the Human World from the Demon World.

141
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:29,396
The world as it should be.

142
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:33,354
We need that small hole

143
00:07:34,396 --> 00:07:35,979
to grow even larger

144
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:39,896
to join the Human
and Demon Worlds together.

145
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:44,646
Don't you want to remove these borders,

146
00:07:45,271 --> 00:07:47,062
and strive for a better world?

147
00:07:47,604 --> 00:07:49,604
[Enma breathing heavily]

148
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:51,854
I'm not gonna let you do that!

Is that right?

150
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,312
So this barrier of yours,

151
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,937
I wonder how long it will last.

[tense music playing]

153
00:08:04,312 --> 00:08:06,812
[Sakyo] The fact that you're
showing your face here

154
00:08:08,146 --> 00:08:11,646
means that the barrier
won't hold for much longer, right?

155
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:13,104
[tense music continues]

156

157
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:17,187
What'll it be?

158
00:08:19,104 --> 00:08:21,729
How would you feel
about raising the stakes a little?

159
00:08:22,312 --> 00:08:23,729

Hiei!

166
00:08:58,062 --> 00:08:58,896
Sorry.

167
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:01,229
We were delayed.

168
00:09:02,729 --> 00:09:03,854
Kurama…

169
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:06,021
Thank you.

170
00:09:06,771 --> 00:09:08,104
[Hiei] Listen, Yusuke.

171
00:09:09,062 --> 00:09:11,187
I'm not doing this to help you, all right?

172
00:09:12,521 --> 00:09:13,646
[laughs]

173
00:09:13,729 --> 00:09:14,854
Let's do it.

174
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:16,979
Shall we play?

175
00:09:18,396 --> 00:09:19,521
Play what?

176
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:24,312
If your guys win, I'll stop the machine.

177
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:27,729
On the other hand, if Toguro wins,

178
00:09:28,437 --> 00:09:30,229
you'll take down that barrier.

179
00:09:32,646 --> 00:09:33,562
[Enma scoffs]

180
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:35,646
Even if we win,

181
00:09:36,646 --> 00:09:39,646
you could always build
another machine just like this.

182
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:42,562
All right.

183
00:09:43,937 --> 00:09:45,729
Why don't I bet my life on it?

184
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:57,021
I've devoted my whole life to this dream.

185
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,437
So, I don't mind

186
00:10:00,354 --> 00:10:01,854
if it costs me my life.

187
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:07,104
Those words,

188

with a young woman and a young man.

317
00:16:35,021 --> 00:16:36,771
They were friends.

318
00:16:36,854 --> 00:16:41,354
The two of them wanted to become
martial arts masters together.

319
00:16:42,062 --> 00:16:43,187
However,

320
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:45,396
as the years passed,

321
00:16:46,229 --> 00:16:49,812
the woman, she grew old and ugly.

322
00:16:51,896 --> 00:16:55,812
While the man, for the sake of training,

323
00:16:55,896 --> 00:16:59,146
became a yokai
with the help of the Demon World,

324
00:16:59,229 --> 00:17:02,437
all in order to preserve his youth.

325
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:04,229
Toguro

326
00:17:05,229 --> 00:17:06,771

[Elder Toguro] The woman,
after giving away her power to a student,

330
00:17:22,979 --> 00:17:26,562
made the foolish decision
to challenge him to a fight.

331
00:17:27,354 --> 00:17:31,021
So they fought,
though she was no match for him.

332
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:34,687
Aah.

333
00:17:37,562 --> 00:17:39,062
That's how my little brother

334
00:17:39,937 --> 00:17:41,312
killed Genkai…

What a happy ending. [chuckles]

Hey, hey, hey.

346
00:18:14,896 --> 00:18:17,771
[inhales deeply] Let go!
What do you think you're doing?

347
00:18:20,104 --> 00:18:22,437
You pawned your soul off too, didn't you?

348
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:25,687
That's irrelevant.

And yet,

00:19:20,854 --> 00:19:23,354
it was a mistake giving it to him.

You see, originally,

437
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,937
this battle was planned
with Yusuke as the winner.

438
00:23:03,521 --> 00:23:04,729
Huh?

439
00:23:04,812 --> 00:23:07,604
To squeeze even more money
out of the rich.

440
00:23:08,896 --> 00:23:09,979
It was fixed?

Yes.

442

you believe you're going
to be spared from death?

- Hmm.

It's possible

475
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:50,812
I may have made a very dangerous bet.

I found out what caused
Toguro's reincarnation as a yokai!

Fifty years ago,

483
00:25:13,937 --> 00:25:18,229
Toguro's very own students
were killed by a yokai named Kairen.

484

This yokai appeared
in order to fight Toguro,

485

and after winning…

486
00:25:25,021 --> 00:25:26,562
those students were

487
00:25:27,896 --> 00:25:29,146

[whooshing]

574
00:31:02,229 --> 00:31:04,937
His Spirit Energy
is almost a match for Toguro's power.

575
00:31:05,021 --> 00:31:09,437
[gasps] Yes, but can he still fight
with his Energy in such disarray?

576
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:10,562
I don't know.

577
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:15,104
Right now, underpinning Yusuke's
Spirit Energy is tremendous sadness.

578
00:31:16,187 --> 00:31:17,562
It's incredibly strong,

579
00:31:18,521 --> 00:31:19,937
but unreliable.

My promise to Master Genkai.

584
00:31:43,146 --> 00:31:45,271
Your friends are no more than an obstacle.

585
00:31:45,354 --> 00:31:46,437
Let them go.

586
00:31:49,187 --> 00:31:51,021
You and I are quite alike.

587
00:31:51,771 --> 00:31:55,021
Throw everything else away
and grow stronger.

588
00:31:55,104 --> 00:31:56,854
I'm not like you, Toguro.

589
00:31:58,521 --> 00:31:59,729
I can't go it alone.

590
00:32:01,062 --> 00:32:02,979
I gave Master Genkai my word.

591
00:32:03,062 --> 00:32:04,521

593
00:32:07,937 --> 00:32:10,146
How very naive.

594
00:32:10,771 --> 00:32:13,687
You're nothing more than Genkai's student.

595
00:32:16,312 --> 00:32:18,437
What will it take for you to understand?

596
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:20,771
Do I have to kill all of your friends?

[somber music playing]

598
00:32:36,771 --> 00:32:40,062
I finally understand the price you paid
for your strength.

599
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:44,396
Master Genkai told us…

600
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:48,812
"The power you have is not real strength."

[Spirit Gun whooshing]

602

[Yusuke] I won't let you kill anyone else.

603
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:04,979
That's why I'm stopping this now.

604
00:33:10,146 --> 00:33:11,354
That's better.

605
00:33:14,396 --> 00:33:17,104

To face someone truly powerful.

733
00:42:29,271 --> 00:42:32,854
for him to voluntarily choose
the worst hell of them all.

Why's that?

735

I guess he wants to punish himself.

Huh?

737
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:47,562
[Enma] He said he threw his friends away,
but in reality, they were stolen from him.

738
00:42:49,521 --> 00:42:53,187
The guilt from not being able to
protect them has haunted him ever since.

739
00:42:56,354 --> 00:43:00,729
The road that he walked
was not one of redemption but of torture.
