00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:35,562
Hey.

4
00:00:36,396 --> 00:00:38,396
Keiko had better be safe. Got that?

5
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:39,562
Why of course.

6
00:00:39,646 --> 00:00:41,771
If you defeat the yokai
that the master is keeping,

7
00:00:41,854 --> 00:00:44,771
we promise we will return the girl to you.

8
00:00:44,854 --> 00:00:46,187
[dramatic music continues]

9
00:00:55,812 --> 00:00:57,187
Sounds like a tournament.

10
00:00:57,271 --> 00:00:59,812
I'd guess they have
a lot of money riding on it.

11
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:01,687
Say again?

12
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:05,896
[Kurama] I hear that they're getting yokai
to fight each other to the death.

13
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:07,771
[Kuwabara] What for?

14
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,521
It's the rich just having fun.

15
00:01:11,812 --> 00:01:13,187
I'm sure that there's more.

16
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:15,604
They wanna see something bad happen.

17
00:01:17,937 --> 00:01:19,104
We have to be careful.

18
00:01:22,104 --> 00:01:24,521
[Kuwabara] There's no way humans
would do that.

it was a last minute invitation,

there wasn't a single absentee.

24
00:01:58,312 --> 00:02:00,437
Everyone must really love
to gamble, right?

25
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:04,312
Hmm. You're the one who likes
to gamble, aren't you?

26
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:09,396
- I like to pretend that I like it.
- Ahh.

27
00:02:10,354 --> 00:02:11,479
[coins clinking]

28
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:18,229
[Sakyo] Heads or tails?

29
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:19,771
Why are you doing this?

30
00:02:20,354 --> 00:02:21,729
[Sakyo] It's just for fun.

31
00:02:21,812 --> 00:02:22,646
Huh.

32
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:25,187
Tails, then.

33
00:02:28,354 --> 00:02:29,312
I won this one.

34
00:02:30,146 --> 00:02:31,979
[Tarukane] Yeah? What's your point?

35
00:02:34,896 --> 00:02:35,937
Let's go again.

36
00:02:37,437 --> 00:02:38,896
[Tarukane] All right. Heads.

37
00:02:43,854 --> 00:02:45,562
Who cares? [grunts]

38
00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:48,229
[Sakyo] Yeah. It is pointless.

39
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:51,937
I'd win any bet you put in front of me.

40
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:54,729
What I'm saying is, I don't lose.

41
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,396
Now you're talking nonsense.

Just listen.

46
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:21,104
Only four times I've gambled
with life instead of chips.

47
00:03:22,396 --> 00:03:23,521
So not that often.

48
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:27,646
There were other opportunities…

49
00:03:30,396 --> 00:03:32,479
but once people realize I'm serious,

50
00:03:33,437 --> 00:03:34,937
they always pull out.

54
00:03:42,896 --> 00:03:45,021
Like an opening game before the big event.

[pensive music playing]

56
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:53,604
The ones who took the bet,

57
00:03:54,104 --> 00:03:56,646
they were people
with rotten brains like mine.

58
00:03:57,354 --> 00:04:00,562
[sighs] Gambling's the only thing
I care for.

59
00:04:00,646 --> 00:04:01,729
Life's too slow.

60
00:04:03,062 --> 00:04:04,646
I can't be fulfilled…

I'll win the next game, too.

67
00:04:19,437 --> 00:04:24,021
So that I can fulfill my dream
and destroy this boredom at last.

00:04:37,646 --> 00:04:39,271
Excuse me, Koenma.

Genkai's death, you…

71
00:04:44,062 --> 00:04:45,396

Not yet.

It's too much.

75
00:04:56,271 --> 00:04:58,771
He needs to stay focused
on the task at hand.

Right.

368
00:27:55,604 --> 00:27:56,812
That's obvious.

Mmm.

Hmm.

379
00:28:24,437 --> 00:28:25,854
Hmm.

it's the same wherever I am, right?

429
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:38,312
Precisely. You're learning.

443
00:32:15,229 --> 00:32:16,812
Did I knock your brain loose?

444
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,771
[Kurama] Do you know
the Seed of the Death Plant?

445
00:32:23,271 --> 00:32:25,021
Gardening? Sounds boring.

446
00:32:25,104 --> 00:32:29,687
[Kurama] It's a parasitic plant that takes
root in the bodies of living creatures.

447
00:32:31,146 --> 00:32:33,479
When I say a certain word, it'll…

448
00:32:34,729 --> 00:32:36,604
begin to grow explosively…

449
00:32:38,771 --> 00:32:40,396
and it will tear you apart.

Huh! Well, this is quite a surprise!

474
00:34:21,354 --> 00:34:24,729
[scoffs] They defeated
the invincible Bui and Karasu!

475
00:34:25,437 --> 00:34:27,979
[man 1] Those two really are strong.

476
00:34:28,062 --> 00:34:31,771
[man 2] Even though I lost some money,
this has still been pretty amusing.

477
00:34:31,854 --> 00:34:34,021
[chuckles] I was starting to get bored.

478
00:34:35,937 --> 00:34:38,771
Well, gentlemen,
your bets will now be collected.

479
00:34:39,312 --> 00:34:41,187
Still, I'm glad you all enjoyed it.

480
00:34:42,979 --> 00:34:46,271
So, Tarukane,
even though you lost ten billion

481
00:34:46,896 --> 00:34:48,729
you must've enjoyed it too, right?

482
00:34:49,812 --> 00:34:52,687
You don't look so well, eh? Tarukane.

483
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:54,771
[laughing]

484
00:34:54,854 --> 00:34:57,312
[man 3] This sort of thing
happens a lot in gambling.

My friend, don't be a sore loser
and say you're quitting.

[laughs]

487
00:35:03,396 --> 00:35:05,229
The game is just getting started.

- [men laughing]
- [man 3] That's the spirit.

489
00:35:07,604 --> 00:35:09,354
As Tarukane just said,

490
00:35:10,312 --> 00:35:12,604
we do have our main event to get to.

Looks like you had a tough fight.

563
00:39:04,771 --> 00:39:07,271

How'd you know that?

606
00:41:37,646 --> 00:41:41,646
For this round, if you get it right,
I'll triple your bet.
