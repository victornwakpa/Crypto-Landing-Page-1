[man] Oh, this?

Goki, Kurama, Hiei.

What these yokai took were all
dangerous objects with huge powers.

If we don't get them back quickly,
the Human World will be in trouble!

40
00:02:04,437 --> 00:02:05,896
Yeah, big trouble.

41
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:08,229
We believed you were ready
to take on the thieves,

but not those three yokai.

43
00:02:09,771 --> 00:02:11,771
- They're really strong!
- [Enma] Exactly.

44
00:02:11,854 --> 00:02:15,229
Which is why I'm teaching you
how to shoot the Spirit Gun. Come on.

45
00:02:15,312 --> 00:02:17,437
I didn't think you'd
be this slow to get it.

If only you were a bit smarter, you'd--

[Enma] Don't raise your voice.

52
00:02:29,104 --> 00:02:33,771
By the way, you want us to stop talking,
use your Spirit Gun. Come on.

53
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:36,271
Sheesh! Sure thing! Yeah, I'll shoot it.

54
00:02:36,354 --> 00:02:38,521

The only way you'll beat these monsters
is if you use the Spirit Gun.

61

Channel the energy inside,

62

[pensive music playing]

81
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:44,479
[Botan] Not if their souls
have been eaten.

82
00:03:46,396 --> 00:03:49,521
That dangerous object.
Goki used it to do all this.

83
00:03:52,562 --> 00:03:54,271
Is there anything I can do now?

84
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:00,646
Get their souls back from Goki.
It's the only way.

85
00:04:03,187 --> 00:04:04,979
Well, that sounds easy enough.

86
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,937
I'll take him on right now.

87
00:04:08,521 --> 00:04:10,729
What? That's a bad idea.

88
00:04:10,812 --> 00:04:13,271
You haven't even got
your Spirit Gun working yet.

89
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:14,479
Forget that!

90
00:04:14,562 --> 00:04:16,312
I don't need a Spirit Gun.

91
00:04:17,104 --> 00:04:19,854
We get these kind of injuries
quite often, right?

92
00:04:19,937 --> 00:04:21,396
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right! [laughing]

93
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:23,187
- You just want attention!
- [laughing]

94

You're in trouble now!
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

95
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:27,021
Hey, hey! Kuwabara, what's with his neck?

96
00:04:27,104 --> 00:04:28,021
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:28,771 --> 00:04:30,896
[breathing heavily] This is all my fault.

98
00:04:34,312 --> 00:04:35,146
No.

99
00:04:36,271 --> 00:04:37,979
Come on. Don't talk that way.

100
00:04:38,062 --> 00:04:40,604
Thanks to you,
we got away with very little damage.

101
00:04:41,937 --> 00:04:43,312
[breathing shakily]

102
00:04:43,396 --> 00:04:44,312
I'm sorry.

103
00:04:54,104 --> 00:04:56,396
Oh! Urameshi! Oh, hey, wait, wait.

104
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,271
- Kuwabara. Kuwabara.
- [Yusuke] Hey, Kuwabara. What's up?

105
00:04:59,354 --> 00:05:01,354
You and I need to talk right now!

106
00:05:01,437 --> 00:05:03,604
You beat up that guy. How'd you do it?

107
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:04,812
He was so strong too.

108
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:08,771
Guess that means it was a yokai
we were fighting, right?

109
00:05:08,854 --> 00:05:10,104
- [Kuwabara] Yokai?
- Don't, don't!

110
00:05:10,187 --> 00:05:12,604
So I drove the yokai out
with my Spirit Energy.

111
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,562
[shushing]

112
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:15,604
Hold on.

113
00:05:15,687 --> 00:05:18,896
- Have you completely lost your mind?
- No, that's the truth.

114
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:20,104
[laughing] Okay.

115
00:05:20,937 --> 00:05:23,854
- Did you get some meds yet?
- You think I'm crazy? Huh?

116
00:05:23,937 --> 00:05:25,271
- Move it. Now!
- Ugh.

117
00:05:25,354 --> 00:05:28,354
[Botan] Stop blabbering on
about the Spirit World and yokai!

118
00:05:28,437 --> 00:05:29,979
[Kuwabara] Geez. Is he okay?

119
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:32,312
Why'd he bring that girl here?

120
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:34,146
[both laughing]

121
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:35,812
I didn't see her.

122
00:05:35,896 --> 00:05:37,729
Huh? The kimono girl.

123
00:05:37,812 --> 00:05:39,229
The one pulling Urameshi.

124
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:41,854
No.

125
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,771
He came here alone.

126
00:05:43,854 --> 00:05:44,937
[mumbling]

127
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:47,437
Kuwabara, maybe you're seeing things!

128
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:48,771
[gasps] This is spooky!

129
00:05:48,854 --> 00:05:50,562
- Scary.
- Scary.

130
00:05:51,354 --> 00:05:52,562
[gasps, groans]

131
00:05:52,646 --> 00:05:54,687
Maybe he's telling me the truth.

132
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,937
[friends muttering]

133
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,021
[intriguing music playing]

134
00:05:59,396 --> 00:06:01,187
[Botan] <i>Out of the three yokai thieves,</i>

135
00:06:01,271 --> 00:06:04,479
<i>Goki is thought of as the most dangerous</i>
<i>in the Human World.</i>

136
00:06:05,437 --> 00:06:08,354
<i>And that's because</i>
<i>Goki feeds off human souls.</i>

137
00:06:09,354 --> 00:06:12,437
<i>His mere existence</i>
<i>is harmful to the human race.</i>

138
00:06:12,521 --> 00:06:14,354
[upbeat rock music playing]

139
00:06:14,437 --> 00:06:16,854
<i>Goki favors children's souls</i>
<i>in particular.</i>

140
00:06:18,146 --> 00:06:21,396
<i>And the Rapacious Orb he has</i>
<i>will suck the soul out of you,</i>

141
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:22,812
<i>and keep them stocked up.</i>

142
00:06:23,937 --> 00:06:25,937
<i>So, basically, the orb ended up</i>

143
00:06:26,021 --> 00:06:28,646
<i>with the last person in the world</i>
<i>who should have it.</i>

144

[Yusuke sighs]

145
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:37,104
Ugh, it's been a while since I've eaten
and we still haven't found anything.

146
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:39,771
Could be that he's
hiding his spiritual energy.

147
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:42,854
It's a little trick
that yokai in your world do.

148
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:46,479
[Yusuke] Are there many yokai
in the Human World?

149
00:06:46,562 --> 00:06:49,896
No. But that wasn't always the case.

150
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,396
So we had to find a way to restore order.

151
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,062
Which was?

152
00:06:54,562 --> 00:06:57,604
We decided to create a barrier
between our two worlds.

153
00:06:57,687 --> 00:07:02,354
So, the stronger yokai are kept out
and your World then remains peaceful.

154
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:05,562
Yeah? And how about
that creature I killed?

155
00:07:05,646 --> 00:07:07,646
Why was it able to cross over like that?

156
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,396
So, um…

157
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,771
- I don't--
- Well, what?

158
00:07:12,646 --> 00:07:13,812
I don't know!

159
00:07:13,896 --> 00:07:15,896
You're supposed to figure that one out!

160
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:18,812
Don't get so agitated. Let's go.

161
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:19,729
Hold on.

162
00:07:19,812 --> 00:07:21,646
- Where are you going?
- [Yusuke] To get food.

163
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:23,354
Wait. How are you so relaxed?

164
00:07:23,437 --> 00:07:26,771
Look, Botan. I'm not a tracking dog,
you understand that?

165
00:07:27,396 --> 00:07:30,062
And do you really think
I can fight in this condition?

166
00:07:30,146 --> 00:07:31,187
I need some food.

167
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:36,187
Planning ahead. But he's still an idiot.

168
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,937
- [Keiko] Oh, you see? He's here.
- [man] Welcome! Come on in.

169
00:07:41,021 --> 00:07:42,729
- Hey!
- [Yusuke] Hey, kid.

170
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,687
Sir, thank you.
You're the reason I'm alive!

171
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:47,312
Nah, why so formal?

172
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:51,604
Sir, thank you for saving my son.
I really can't thank you enough.

173
00:07:52,312 --> 00:07:54,312

00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:05,771
It'll be just a little while now.

358
00:18:07,812 --> 00:18:10,312
I promise I'm gonna get you out of here.

359
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:14,229
But why?

360
00:18:17,854 --> 00:18:20,146
I have a younger sister about your age.

361
00:18:27,562 --> 00:18:29,562

[birds chirping]

368
00:19:00,937 --> 00:19:01,854
[girl] Hello.

369
00:19:01,937 --> 00:19:02,979
Oh, hello.

370
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:12,396
[Botan] Huh? Kurama was watching?

371
00:19:12,479 --> 00:19:13,979
What was Kurama doing?

372
00:19:14,062 --> 00:19:16,812
[Yusuke] Well, I told you,
he was just watching.

373
00:19:16,896 --> 00:19:18,896
- He wasn't trying to help Goki either.
- Wh-- Whoa.

374
00:19:20,354 --> 00:19:22,104
What he's playing at, I don't know.

375
00:19:22,687 --> 00:19:24,104
But it was pretty sinister.

376
00:19:25,271 --> 00:19:26,896
Kurama is a yokai in human skin.

377
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:28,521
An effective disguise.

378
00:19:28,604 --> 00:19:30,937
He's also revealed almost nothing to us,

379
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:33,646
which means
he's quite the cunning adversary.

380
00:19:33,729 --> 00:19:35,937
Plus, he is one of Goki's monsters.

381
00:19:36,646 --> 00:19:38,812
And Kurama possesses
the Mirror of Darkness

382
00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:41,687
which will grant him
whatever he desires, I'm afraid.

383
00:19:42,271 --> 00:19:44,479
However evil the desire,
it will come true.

384
00:19:44,562 --> 00:19:45,812
We can't let that happen.

385
00:19:46,396 --> 00:19:47,687
Anything? Really?

386
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:48,896
Anything!

387
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,229
Natural disasters, mass killings…

388
00:19:51,312 --> 00:19:52,354
You name it!

389
00:19:52,437 --> 00:19:53,729
[Yusuke] Are you serious?

390
00:19:54,229 --> 00:19:57,604
[Botan] The Mirror of Darkness reveals
its powers under a full moon.

391
00:19:57,687 --> 00:20:00,312
We have to take it away
from him before then.

392
00:20:00,396 --> 00:20:01,229
Yeah.

393
00:20:02,396 --> 00:20:03,271

Whoa.

396
00:20:07,396 --> 00:20:08,521
This won't light.

[rock music playing]

398
00:20:11,562 --> 00:20:12,396
Wait.

399
00:20:15,562 --> 00:20:16,437
Really?

400
00:20:17,396 --> 00:20:18,312
Whoa.

401
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:21,979
Wha-- Huh…

402
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:25,104
- [woman 1] Thank you for waiting.
- [man] Come on in!

403
00:20:25,187 --> 00:20:27,104
[woman 2] Welcome! Go ahead.

[Yusuke grunts]

409
00:21:20,521 --> 00:21:23,354
Oh, hello. I… it's ready.
Just one moment please.

410
00:21:23,979 --> 00:21:25,646
Thanks for coming, as always.

00:21:27,937 --> 00:21:29,937

413
00:21:44,562 --> 00:21:45,812
[Botan] Koenma, I…

414
00:21:46,396 --> 00:21:48,354
I think that this is…

415
00:21:48,854 --> 00:21:52,146
Yes. Most likely Kurama's seen Yusuke.

416
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,229
It could be a trap.

417
00:21:55,312 --> 00:21:57,771

423

Don't worry.

424
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,437
Once I achieve my goal,

425
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,896
I'll return the Mirror of Darkness.

426
00:23:14,604 --> 00:23:15,771
[woman] Shuichi?

427
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:17,979
You came?

- [grunts feebly]
- [Kurama sighs]

429
00:23:21,729 --> 00:23:23,479
Hold on, Mom, you need to lie down.

430
00:23:23,562 --> 00:23:24,771
[chuckles] It's okay.

431
00:23:25,354 --> 00:23:26,979
I would like to greet your friend, son.

432
00:23:27,062 --> 00:23:29,271
He travelled all this way
just to visit me.

433
00:23:29,354 --> 00:23:30,479
[inhales deeply]

00:23:31,979 --> 00:23:33,729
You two are friends?

436
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,479
[chuckles] I must look like
quite a sight to you.

437
00:23:37,896 --> 00:23:39,396
But I'm glad you're here.

438
00:23:40,062 --> 00:23:41,104
It's a relief.

439
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:46,021
You stopping by each day is
always a real treat, you know.

440
00:23:46,687 --> 00:23:50,729
As your mother, it worries me
you don't get the chance to make friends.

441
00:23:52,729 --> 00:23:55,229
[coughing]

442
00:23:55,312 --> 00:23:57,396
- What's wrong?
- [continues coughing]

443
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,396
Easy. You in pain?

444
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,437
Just a minute. Just a minute.

445
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:04,062

[Kurama] <i>Were you surprised?</i>

449
00:24:12,271 --> 00:24:13,771
[Yusuke] <i>Yeah. I was.</i>

450
00:24:15,562 --> 00:24:18,604
Shuichi is the disguise I use
in the Human World.

451
00:24:19,937 --> 00:24:22,229
And Shiori is my mother for now.

452
00:24:23,854 --> 00:24:26,479
I've been deceiving that woman
for many years.

453
00:24:28,229 --> 00:24:29,354
I don't understand.

454
00:24:30,146 --> 00:24:31,687
Seventeen years back,

455
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:35,271
this creature attacked,
leaving me seriously injured.

456
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:37,937
So I hatched a plan.

457
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:40,854
To stay safe, I entered a fertilized egg.

458
00:24:44,021 --> 00:24:46,021
My plan was to let her raise me.

459
00:24:47,271 --> 00:24:49,937
I was going to move on
once I regained my strength.

460
00:24:52,937 --> 00:24:54,271
You had a change of heart?

461
00:24:56,354 --> 00:24:57,271
[sighs]

462
00:25:02,229 --> 00:25:03,646
Do you think yokai

463
00:25:04,896 --> 00:25:07,021
can feel something like compassion?

464
00:25:09,854 --> 00:25:11,021
[Yusuke sighs]

465
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:14,187
[Kurama] I didn't think so either.

466
00:25:16,729 --> 00:25:18,979
Then something changed when she fell ill.

467
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:23,396
[somber music playing]

468
00:25:26,062 --> 00:25:28,521
They told me
she wouldn't last a month like this.

469
00:25:33,062 --> 00:25:34,062
[Yusuke sighs]

470
00:25:35,354 --> 00:25:37,396
[Kurama] So, I want to use this mirror…

471
00:25:39,021 --> 00:25:40,437
to help my mom.

472
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:41,562
[pulsating]

473
00:25:42,396 --> 00:25:44,062
[Kurama] That's my only wish.

474
00:25:44,854 --> 00:25:47,854
Once that is done,
I will return the Mirror of Darkness.

475
00:25:52,104 --> 00:25:53,687
Why are you telling me this?

476
00:25:58,646 --> 00:26:01,854
I guess I just wanted someone
to hear my confession.

477
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,604
[chuckles softly]

478
00:26:06,604 --> 00:26:07,896
And above all,

479
00:26:09,396 --> 00:26:11,229
I think I can trust you.

480
00:26:11,312 --> 00:26:13,312

[Botan sniffles]

484
00:26:31,812 --> 00:26:34,146
I didn't realize his situation.

[sobbing]

486
00:26:36,437 --> 00:26:38,187
His mother is dying.

487
00:26:38,271 --> 00:26:40,437
Those two deserve to be happy.

488
00:26:41,271 --> 00:26:42,979
That's going to be difficult.

489
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:45,687
Huh?

490
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,562
[doctor] Here we go.
This may sting a little.

491
00:26:47,646 --> 00:26:48,771
- [man groaning]
- There.

492
00:26:49,312 --> 00:26:51,312
[groaning continues]

493
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:55,812
[doctor] Let's continue.

494
00:26:55,896 --> 00:26:57,187
A little bit more.

495
00:26:57,271 --> 00:26:59,812
- [groaning]
- There. Good, good, good.

496
00:26:59,896 --> 00:27:02,229
- [groans]
- [doctor] There. You're doing great.

497
00:27:02,312 --> 00:27:04,937
- [whimpering]
- [doctor] Good, good, not much more.

498
00:27:05,771 --> 00:27:06,771
[breathes deeply]

499
00:27:06,854 --> 00:27:09,271
[doctor] Hang in there. We're almost done.

500
00:27:09,937 --> 00:27:10,896
[inhales sharply]

501
00:27:11,854 --> 00:27:13,854
[indistinct chatter]

502
00:27:15,437 --> 00:27:16,937
- [man] Thank you!
- [Keiko] Thank you!

503
00:27:17,021 --> 00:27:18,271
[woman] Thank you so much!!

504
00:27:18,354 --> 00:27:20,187
- See ya.
- [woman] Please, come again.

505
00:27:24,812 --> 00:27:26,229
Your noodles will get cold.

506
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,104
Hey, Keiko.

507
00:27:29,187 --> 00:27:30,021
Hmm?

508
00:27:30,854 --> 00:27:32,062
Yokai--

509
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:34,562
Or, it's just…

510
00:27:38,062 --> 00:27:39,646
Is there good and bad

511
00:27:40,521 --> 00:27:41,771
inside of everybody?

512
00:27:42,937 --> 00:27:44,937
Wait. What are you asking now?

513
00:27:45,021 --> 00:27:46,687
[Yusuke] Oh, it's just a thought.

514
00:27:48,229 --> 00:27:49,646
Mmm…

515
00:27:50,729 --> 00:27:51,937
I guess…

516
00:27:54,437 --> 00:27:56,021
Oh! Like for example,

517
00:27:56,104 --> 00:27:58,687
most people who don't know you very well,

518
00:27:58,771 --> 00:28:02,687
they have the impression that you're
a bit of a rebel and a troublemaker.

519
00:28:03,687 --> 00:28:04,604
I guess.

520
00:28:05,437 --> 00:28:07,687
But I know you're not really like that.

521
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:09,104
[faucet running]

522
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,937
'Cause I judge people for myself.

523
00:28:11,812 --> 00:28:14,937
I don't care if everyone else tells me
that someone is bad.

524
00:28:15,021 --> 00:28:17,812
If someone seems good to me,
then I say they're good.

525
00:28:18,937 --> 00:28:20,104
By the same token,

526
00:28:20,187 --> 00:28:22,687
even if the whole world
thinks highly of someone,

527
00:28:22,771 --> 00:28:26,271
if I think they're actually a jerk,
then they're a jerk.

528
00:28:28,437 --> 00:28:29,479
And guess what?

529
00:28:30,187 --> 00:28:31,812
I learned that from you, Yusuke.

530
00:28:34,187 --> 00:28:35,146
What?

531
00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:36,937
[laughs] Just kidding.

532
00:28:37,021 --> 00:28:38,146
[customer] Keiko.

533
00:28:38,229 --> 00:28:39,937
- Beer, please.
- All right!

[Botan] Yusuke! There's trouble!

537
00:28:55,312 --> 00:28:57,854
What are you doing, Yusuke?
Let's go. Right now!

538
00:28:58,979 --> 00:29:01,396
Come on, hurry! What are you doing?

539
00:29:03,854 --> 00:29:06,479
I haven't even had my ramen yet.
What's the rush?

540
00:29:06,562 --> 00:29:08,229
Because you need to hear this.

541
00:29:08,312 --> 00:29:12,062
It's the Mirror. There's more to it
that Koenma didn't tell you.

542
00:29:12,146 --> 00:29:13,104
Huh?

543
00:29:13,187 --> 00:29:15,521
When you make a wish,
and the Mirror grants it,

544
00:29:15,604 --> 00:29:17,312
it takes away something in return.

545
00:29:19,312 --> 00:29:20,396
What something?

546
00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:23,312
The life of the person making the wish.

547
00:29:24,021 --> 00:29:26,021
[brooding music playing]

548
00:29:27,312 --> 00:29:28,729
It's a full moon tonight,

549
00:29:28,812 --> 00:29:31,521
so the Mirror of Darkness
will show its powers.

550
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,021
- We have to run.
- [Kuwabara] Urameshi!

551
00:29:36,521 --> 00:29:37,812
What is it, Kuwabara?

552
00:29:37,896 --> 00:29:39,479
Come on. You're joking, right?

553
00:29:39,562 --> 00:29:40,396
Huh?

554
00:29:41,187 --> 00:29:44,271
You're off to the hospital
to save that yokai. Isn't that right?

555
00:29:45,146 --> 00:29:46,646
Hold on! How'd you know?

556
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:53,229
Didn't we see a yokai burn
someone's house down the other day?

557
00:29:53,312 --> 00:29:56,812
Then you're under no obligation
to do anything for that guy.

558
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:58,896
[music intensifies]

559
00:30:00,354 --> 00:30:01,854
Out of the way, Kuwabara.

560
00:30:03,729 --> 00:30:05,562
Get back here now!

561
00:30:05,646 --> 00:30:07,062
[panting]

562
00:30:09,229 --> 00:30:11,021
[panting] Shit!

563
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:16,854
[monitor beeping]

564
00:30:17,604 --> 00:30:19,604
[Mirror pulsating]

[breathing heavily]

569
00:31:09,396 --> 00:31:10,854
I wish…

570
00:31:12,646 --> 00:31:15,146
for a good, long life for my mother.

571
00:31:16,979 --> 00:31:19,146
- [whooshing]
- [Kurama grunting]

572
00:31:23,021 --> 00:31:23,979
[breathing heavily]

573
00:31:24,062 --> 00:31:25,854
- Shit!
- Urameshi!

574
00:31:25,937 --> 00:31:27,937
[both panting]

575
00:31:28,604 --> 00:31:30,604
[mystical whooshing]

576
00:31:31,812 --> 00:31:33,187
- Damn it!
- Hey!

577
00:31:33,271 --> 00:31:34,562
[grunting]

578
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:37,229
This is a trap! He's a yokai! He's lying!

579
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,396
It's my decision! Not yours! Let go!

580
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:42,021
- No way, you can't!
- [Yusuke grunts]

581
00:31:42,104 --> 00:31:43,896
I won't let you die again.

582
00:31:44,729 --> 00:31:46,729
Because I still haven't won against you.

583
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:49,812
Kuwabara.

584
00:31:49,896 --> 00:31:50,771

Shit!

587
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:55,146
Urameshi!

588

[panting]

592
00:32:01,937 --> 00:32:03,396
[Kurama] What are you doing?

593
00:32:03,937 --> 00:32:05,771
I'm here to put an end to this!

594
00:32:06,271 --> 00:32:07,812
Don't get in my way!

595
00:32:07,896 --> 00:32:09,979
You know she's going to die
if I don't do this!

596
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:12,687
And if you die, your mother's
going to mourn you forever!

597
00:32:15,812 --> 00:32:17,771
Take it from me. It's heartbreaking.

598
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:20,687
[somber music continues]

599
00:32:23,521 --> 00:32:25,854
[Yusuke] There's no point
to all this if you die.

600
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:29,646
Hey, Mirror!

601
00:32:31,604 --> 00:32:33,521
I'm gonna give you half my life too.

602
00:32:34,187 --> 00:32:35,562
No, stop it!

603
00:32:35,646 --> 00:32:38,062

00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:01,771
Come on! Urameshi!

611

- Hey, Urameshi. [panting]
- [breathing shakily]

612
00:33:06,729 --> 00:33:08,729
[Kuwabara] Hey, come on. Come on.

Oh no.

617
00:33:22,229 --> 00:33:23,187
Are you there?

There you are, son.

[gentle music continues]

624

Mmm. [exhales]

625
00:34:13,771 --> 00:34:14,896
I'm right here.

626
00:34:17,562 --> 00:34:19,104
I'm not going anywhere.

627
00:34:20,687 --> 00:34:21,729
Understand?

633
00:34:49,146 --> 00:34:50,104
I'm sorry.

634
00:34:51,729 --> 00:34:52,979
I was mistaken.

635
00:34:58,062 --> 00:34:59,396
Earlier, I was…

636
00:35:00,229 --> 00:35:01,687
about to have noodles.

637
00:35:05,354 --> 00:35:06,771

Well, who the hell stole it?!
Find out right now!

656
00:37:24,771 --> 00:37:28,146
[man] From how it was done, sir,
it looks like it was the work of a yokai…

00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:29,437
A yokai?

658

You son a bitch!

662
00:37:41,979 --> 00:37:44,604
My good luck has been ruined
ever since our deal.

663
00:37:44,687 --> 00:37:48,312
Those Tears of Ice I extracted
have caught the attention of a yokai!

664
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:52,937
I don't want to be involved
in any trouble. Hear me?

665
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,771
So I'm going to return Korime.
