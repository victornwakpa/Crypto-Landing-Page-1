[theme music playing]

2
00:00:10,271 --> 00:00:14,312
[Enma] <i>Yusuke, the Spirit Detective,</i>
<i>retrieved the Rapacious Orb from Goki.</i>

3
00:00:15,604 --> 00:00:17,437
<i>Then, on learning of Kurama's wish…</i>

4
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:19,521
[Yusuke] I'm going to
give you half my life too.

5
00:00:19,604 --> 00:00:20,479
[Kurama] Stop it!

6
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:24,146
[Enma] <i>He gave up half of his life</i>
<i>and recovered the Mirror of Darkness.</i>

7
00:00:24,687 --> 00:00:27,771
<i>The only remaining dangerous object is</i>
<i>the Conjuring Blade,</i>

8
00:00:27,854 --> 00:00:29,646

[music ends]

10
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:34,312
[Enma] <i>On being tasked</i>
<i>with retrieving this too,</i>

11
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:37,479
<i>Yusuke infiltrated a certain mansion.</i>

12
00:00:37,562 --> 00:00:39,562
[tense music playing]

13
00:00:43,396 --> 00:00:44,437
Hey, Koenma.

14
00:00:44,937 --> 00:00:47,021
You really think he's gonna show his face?

15
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:50,646
[Enma] The only people Hiei attacks
are subordinates of the jeweler.

16
00:00:51,604 --> 00:00:54,562
So, it's likely he'll show up
and target the mansion's owner.

17
00:00:54,646 --> 00:00:56,604
Hold on, you're saying you're not sure?

18
00:00:56,687 --> 00:00:58,521
[Enma] <i>That's why</i>
<i>you're investigating, idiot!</i>

19
00:00:58,604 --> 00:01:02,062
So shut up and focus
on retrieving the Conjuring Blade, yeah?

20
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:03,854
You're the boss.

21
00:01:03,937 --> 00:01:06,646
You know, I should sue you
for harassment when this is over.

22
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:07,812
[Enma] <i>Are you listening?</i>

23
00:01:08,646 --> 00:01:10,146
It's a dangerous object,

24
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:12,896
one that grants its wielder
their desired ability.

25
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:15,021
We don't know
what kind of power he's gained.

26
00:01:15,687 --> 00:01:18,021
<i>Be very careful</i>
<i>with how you proceed, got it?</i>

27
00:01:18,937 --> 00:01:19,937
Yeah, I got it.

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:28,771
[laughs] How about that?!

33
00:01:28,854 --> 00:01:30,396
My guess was as good as gold!

34
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,771
[both laugh]

35
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:34,104

The Korime isn't here anymore! I swear!

[Yusuke panting]

42
00:01:51,521 --> 00:01:52,604
Hiei, yeah?

43
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:58,396
You're not the type to hand over the
Conjuring Blade without a fight, are you?

44
00:02:00,146 --> 00:02:01,312
I know who sent you.

45
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:03,937
I'm not giving it to you.

00:02:32,646 --> 00:02:33,896
What a waste.

56
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:36,396
Even without drawing this sword,
I've beaten you.

57

61
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:27,729
[Sakyo] Tarukane, thank you
for coming all this way.

00:03:27,812 --> 00:03:28,896
Sakyo!

63
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:31,354
A yokai is after us! There was an attack!

64
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:33,771
I'm sorry to hear that.

65
00:03:33,854 --> 00:03:35,104
Well, you're safe now.

66
00:03:36,896 --> 00:03:40,604
They're after that Korime. I know it.
What are you gonna do?

67
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,104
You don't have to worry.

68
00:03:42,646 --> 00:03:44,896
I promise that you'll be safe
on this island.

69
00:03:54,062 --> 00:03:56,646
- [man] Hey, I've got an interesting story.
- Here you go.

70
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:58,979
Yes, tell me! [laughs]

71
00:03:59,062 --> 00:04:00,437
[man laughs] Oh, ho!

72
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:02,479
Well, if it isn't Tarukane!

73
00:04:02,562 --> 00:04:04,937
You finally made it
into the club, have you?

74
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:06,687
- Huh?
- [chuckles]

75
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:11,896
Please. As you see, I offer
a kind of amusement for the wealthy

76
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:15,437
who have exhausted
their other indulgences.

77
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,021
[Tarukane] Well, I didn't come here
to play, Sakyo.

78
00:04:18,104 --> 00:04:19,062
[Sakyo] I know.

79
00:04:19,146 --> 00:04:22,354
But I think if you see this
with your own eyes,

80
00:04:22,854 --> 00:04:25,312
you'll understand why
you should believe me.

81
00:04:25,396 --> 00:04:27,396

What the hell are you doing?

86
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,771
It's a competition between two yokai.

87
00:04:49,562 --> 00:04:52,521
[roaring]

[punch lands loudly]

97
00:05:27,396 --> 00:05:28,937
[man] Ha! What a letdown!

98
00:05:30,104 --> 00:05:32,771
You're gonna get taken down
that easy? Son of a bitch!

99
00:05:32,854 --> 00:05:34,729
[laughing]

100
00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:37,104
Well, you did bet on a long shot.

101
00:05:37,896 --> 00:05:39,271
[laughs]

102
00:05:40,062 --> 00:05:41,854
Toguro will be your new guard.

103
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:47,646
- Do you have a problem with that?
- [Tarukane] Not at all.

104
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:50,396
No.

105
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:54,104
So, now that I've gained your trust,

106
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:58,562
let's have the Korime moved
to a safe place.

107
00:06:16,271 --> 00:06:18,021
Let's use this one here.

108
00:06:18,104 --> 00:06:19,229
Get her inside.

109
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:34,979
[Tarukane] Wha--

110
00:06:38,854 --> 00:06:40,854
[suspenseful music playing]

111
00:06:48,271 --> 00:06:49,312
[tires screeching]

112
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:52,771
Hurry!

113
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:55,479
We'll use that chopper to leave!

114
00:06:55,562 --> 00:06:57,854
No, wait. You'll be targeted
as well if you help me!

115
00:06:57,937 --> 00:06:59,771
Right now, just worry
about yourself. All right?

116
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:01,271
[panting]

117
00:07:06,396 --> 00:07:08,396
You know, what he said is right.

118
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,229
Self-preservation is
an important instinct.

119
00:07:13,354 --> 00:07:14,979
- [man groans]
- [gasps]

120

[groaning, panting]

123
00:07:24,187 --> 00:07:25,229
Well,

124
00:07:25,937 --> 00:07:27,646
I suppose it doesn't matter

125
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:30,187
since you're going to die
very soon anyway.

126
00:07:30,271 --> 00:07:33,479
[ominous music playing]

127
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,104

[high-pitched ringing]

129
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:48,687
[gasps] Good work!

130
00:07:49,562 --> 00:07:51,729
Yes, very good!

131
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:54,479
Glad you're satisfied with our work.

132
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:00,062
Tell me about
these two characters right there.

133
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,229
[monitor beeps]

134
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:04,312
[Sakyo] It seems that one is human

135
00:08:05,104 --> 00:08:06,687
and the other is a yokai.

136
00:08:08,854 --> 00:08:10,229
They're dangerous.

137
00:08:10,312 --> 00:08:12,104
To ensure your safe return…

138
00:08:13,854 --> 00:08:15,646
I'll have them take care of you.

139
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:20,771
[thrilling music playing]

140
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:37,229
[music fades]

141
00:08:38,604 --> 00:08:40,187
[people clamoring]

142
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:42,687
[Botan] People say,
"Taking candy from a baby,"

143
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:46,062
but if your enemy is too weak,
you won't want to take anything at all.

144
00:08:46,604 --> 00:08:50,687
Well, anyway, there's no need
to be so down! Come on! Cheer up!

145
00:08:50,771 --> 00:08:52,646
You're the reason I'm so depressed.

146
00:08:52,729 --> 00:08:54,646
- Okay?
- [Botan] That's enough complaining.

147
00:08:55,229 --> 00:08:57,979
Koenma wants you to meet someone
that can help your training.

148
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,104
Uh-- Seriously?

149
00:09:00,729 --> 00:09:03,854
She's a renowned fighter
named Master Genkai.

150
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:08,187
She uses the Spirit Wave, which draws
on the human body's spiritual energy.

151
00:09:08,271 --> 00:09:11,729
It'll be good for you because
you can't command Spirit Energy very well.

152
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:12,646
Huh?

153
00:09:13,396 --> 00:09:15,062
Screw that. There's no way.

154
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:17,437
I can figure it out without her.

155
00:09:17,937 --> 00:09:21,437
What I need to know is how to beat
that guy's speed. That's what.

156
00:09:21,521 --> 00:09:23,146
All this carrying on.

157
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,521
Just shut up.
You need to start training now.

158
00:09:25,604 --> 00:09:28,021
[Kuwabara]
Hold that conversation right there.

159
00:09:30,312 --> 00:09:32,646
If you're training, then I'm coming along!

160
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:34,854
[both] Huh?

161
00:09:34,937 --> 00:09:38,312
[upbeat song playing]

162
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:57,979
Hello, Genkai. [chuckling]

163
00:09:58,062 --> 00:09:59,771
It's a great honor.

164
00:09:59,854 --> 00:10:02,437
[Genkai] I was told
there would only be one student.

165
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:06,062
Uh, sor-- sorry, Master Genkai. It's just…

166
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:08,354
He sort of just tagged along.

167
00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:09,979
Yes! [sighs]

168
00:10:10,062 --> 00:10:13,229
Kazuma Kuwabara.
I look forward to training with you.

169
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:16,146
You have drive.

170
00:10:17,146 --> 00:10:19,937
I would like to know the reason
you wish to train.

171
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,146
I think to learn the fighting spirit.

172
00:10:23,979 --> 00:10:28,271
I must confess that I can't proudly
call myself this guy's rival yet.

173
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:30,771
[Yusuke] Hmm?

174
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:33,396
- Just who is whose rival now?
- Huh?

175
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:35,021
Son of a bitch.

176
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:37,937
How dare you ridicule
a man's strength and focus!

177
00:10:38,021 --> 00:10:39,979
You're my rival? Come on!
There's no way in hell!

178
00:10:40,062 --> 00:10:41,854
- Hey, stop it now.
- We've always been rivals!

179
00:10:41,937 --> 00:10:45,021
- Knock it off, loser! Go back to school!
- [Kuwabara] We have always been rivals!

180
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:47,562
- [Yusuke] You're so full of it!
- [Kuwabara] When did we stop being rivals?

181
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:49,562
- [Yusuke] We never were!
- Silence!

[Genkai] You are a noisy pair, aren't you?

185
00:11:01,187 --> 00:11:03,812
Don't just loiter around,
come on and follow me.

186
00:11:04,604 --> 00:11:06,104
The training is starting!

187

[both groaning]

188
00:11:07,687 --> 00:11:08,646

191
00:11:13,104 --> 00:11:13,937
[Botan] Hurry!

192
00:11:14,562 --> 00:11:15,562
Let's go now!

193
00:11:16,312 --> 00:11:17,479
[all panting]

194
00:11:18,771 --> 00:11:19,896

[continues straining]

199
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:50,104
You are to hold this for 12 hours.

200
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:52,396
Are you crazy? [grunting]

[exhales] Impossible…

204
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,021
Delinquents these days.

205
00:12:02,104 --> 00:12:03,812
You've got no grit, son!

206
00:12:05,187 --> 00:12:07,646
Go take five and then we're starting over.

207
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:09,854
[Yusuke] Hey.

208
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,146
Just what is the point
of this training anyway?

209
00:12:12,229 --> 00:12:13,354
[Genkai] No questions!

210
00:12:13,437 --> 00:12:16,104
A fool like you
doesn't need to think about "meaning."

211
00:12:16,729 --> 00:12:18,646
Just feel it with your body.

212
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:21,479
Then why not make the training useful
for a change?

213
00:12:21,562 --> 00:12:23,604
I came here to get stronger. That's all.

214
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:26,312
[breathing heavily]

215
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:29,437
If you think my words are useless,
then very well.

216
00:12:38,729 --> 00:12:40,312
All right. Attack now.

217
00:12:40,396 --> 00:12:42,021

00:13:08,312 --> 00:13:10,771
[Genkai] You can't be popular
with the ladies.

226
00:13:10,854 --> 00:13:12,937
You're far too impatient!

[Yusuke grunting]

238
00:13:46,437 --> 00:13:49,771

[Genkai] Now don't go getting cocky.

257

Before you start complaining,
why not try practicing?

You opened the Jagan Eye?

I'm handling this alone.

293

That sword…

294
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:34,354
would you hand it over
since you're done with it?

295
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:38,021
What's that?

296
00:16:38,521 --> 00:16:40,854
I'd like to give it
to that Spirit Detective.

00:16:41,812 --> 00:16:43,354
Are you serious?

298
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:44,271
Mmm.

299
00:16:45,854 --> 00:16:46,687
That's right.

300
00:16:52,854 --> 00:16:57,312
In return maybe I can get information
from someone on her whereabouts.

301
00:16:57,937 --> 00:16:59,354
Quit joking around.

302
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,521

00:17:27,562 --> 00:17:29,104
[scientist] With this machine,

307
00:17:29,187 --> 00:17:32,437
we have succeeded in generating
an enormous amount of energy.

308
00:17:32,937 --> 00:17:35,146
However, with a chamber of this size,

309
00:17:35,646 --> 00:17:39,687
all we can do is produce a hole
the size of a fist in the dimension.

310
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:41,271
[Sakyo] Then it's meaningless.

311
00:17:41,771 --> 00:17:43,562
The hole needs to be bigger.

312
00:17:44,187 --> 00:17:45,562
It's not that simple.

313
00:17:45,646 --> 00:17:48,062
We'd require
another huge infusion of money.

00:17:52,062 --> 00:17:53,396

I honestly have no idea, but either way,
I'll continue to assist in your project.

322
00:18:31,354 --> 00:18:34,187
I've just become too strong
for this world.

323
00:18:36,104 --> 00:18:38,896
I need to go to the Demon World,
whatever it takes.

- How sad.
- [Yusuke pants]

329
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:03,187
You'll never beat Hiei
if you can't do this simple exercise.

330
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:04,562
Oh, quiet!

331
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,562
Didn't you say you wanted to get stronger?

[Yusuke grunts]

333
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:11,812
- [Yusuke] That's right.
- Why's that?

334
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:15,312
I need to get strong…

335
00:19:16,896 --> 00:19:18,312
if I'm gonna beat Hiei.

336
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:21,604
[Genkai] What does it matter
if you can't beat him?

337
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:23,479
Huh?

338
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:27,521
Even if you give up your training,
it won't matter to anyone else.

339
00:19:28,021 --> 00:19:32,104
Understand that if you don't fight,
many others can fight in your place.

340
00:19:32,187 --> 00:19:34,521
I could.
Even that Kuwabara kid could do it.

341
00:19:34,604 --> 00:19:36,687
[scoffs] No. You're wrong.

342
00:19:38,562 --> 00:19:41,062
All this was the condition
for living again.

343
00:19:41,646 --> 00:19:43,021
What "condition"?

344
00:19:44,229 --> 00:19:45,771
You are mistaken, Yusuke,

345
00:19:45,854 --> 00:19:49,646
if you believe you can defeat your enemy
with such a feeble resolve.

346
00:19:50,771 --> 00:19:54,562
After all, do you really think
that Koenma would force you

347
00:19:54,646 --> 00:19:57,396
back to the afterlife
if you quit your training?

348
00:19:58,479 --> 00:20:00,687
Just a few things for you to consider.

Ah! Hello, Genkai!

353
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:23,896
So, is Yusuke doing well?

354
00:20:23,979 --> 00:20:25,937
[Genkai] He is utterly hopeless.

355
00:20:26,771 --> 00:20:29,229
[exhales] Yes. That does sound right.

356
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:32,812
Tell Koenma that Yusuke
won't amount to anything.

357
00:20:35,396 --> 00:20:36,312
[inhales sharply]

358
00:20:37,396 --> 00:20:38,271
[gasps]

359
00:20:38,854 --> 00:20:39,896
[sighs]

360
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:41,521
[whimsical music playing]

361
00:20:49,437 --> 00:20:53,312
Kuwabara deciding to tag along
and train with Genkai was quite a shock.

362
00:20:55,437 --> 00:20:57,021
Y-Yes…

363
00:20:57,562 --> 00:20:58,979
Apologies, uh…

364
00:20:59,854 --> 00:21:00,854
No worries.

365
00:21:01,937 --> 00:21:04,771
Anyway, they've been training
for a while now.

366
00:21:05,354 --> 00:21:06,646
Is Yusuke ready? Huh?

367
00:21:08,687 --> 00:21:11,979
Mmm…

368
00:21:13,979 --> 00:21:17,729
I think Yusuke's patience is
reaching a breaking point.

369
00:21:17,812 --> 00:21:18,812
[music stops]

370
00:21:18,896 --> 00:21:19,812
Huh?

371
00:21:20,937 --> 00:21:22,937
[crickets chirping]

372
00:21:30,354 --> 00:21:32,354
[lighter clicking]

373
00:21:36,937 --> 00:21:38,354
Ah, shit!

374
00:21:39,437 --> 00:21:41,729
- [Kuwabara grunting]
- [wooden sword thudding]

375
00:21:41,812 --> 00:21:44,771
- [Kuwabara] Come on! [grunting]
- [wooden sword thudding]

376
00:21:45,354 --> 00:21:46,896
[Kuwabara panting]

[Kuwabara grunting]

378
00:21:57,854 --> 00:21:59,187
[Kuwabara] Son of a bitch!

379
00:21:59,271 --> 00:22:00,312
[panting]

380
00:22:00,396 --> 00:22:02,354
I can't believe he's still at it.

381
00:22:03,437 --> 00:22:04,437
[yells]

382
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:06,604
[panting]

383
00:22:07,937 --> 00:22:08,979
[Kuwabara] Shit!

384
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:11,062
[panting]

385
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:25,521
[inhales deeply]

386

[panting]

388
00:22:39,562 --> 00:22:41,437
I can't lose anymore.

389
00:22:42,062 --> 00:22:43,521
[pensive music playing]

390
00:22:43,604 --> 00:22:45,062

391
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:47,687

[music continues]

393
00:22:55,937 --> 00:22:56,812
[inhales sharply]

394
00:23:00,354 --> 00:23:04,771
A man who can't protect
what's important to him

395
00:23:04,854 --> 00:23:06,521
is no man at all.

396
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,187
[breathing heavily]

397
00:23:11,271 --> 00:23:13,271
[inspirational music playing]

398
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,271
Hmm?

399
00:23:21,729 --> 00:23:26,104
I'll become a stronger fighter
than that jerk! Just watch me!

400
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:27,396
[whooshes]

401
00:23:28,854 --> 00:23:30,854
[rumbling]

404

[exhales]

405
00:23:47,771 --> 00:23:48,771
I did it.

406
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:51,229
I did it.

407
00:23:53,562 --> 00:23:57,646
Holy shit, I did it!

408
00:23:57,729 --> 00:23:59,729
[music continues]

409
00:24:18,937 --> 00:24:20,437

[chuckles]

411
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:26,937
TRAINING DAY 20

412
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:29,021
[birds chirping]

413
00:24:44,896 --> 00:24:46,896
[pensive music playing]

414
00:24:50,229 --> 00:24:52,229
[Yusuke breathing deeply]

415
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:02,062
[Genkai] Well, this is surprising.

416
00:25:04,146 --> 00:25:06,021
He's been like that since last night.

417
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,979
He even said
that he'll beat Kuwabara, just you wait.

418
00:25:09,062 --> 00:25:10,854
Yes. Fascinating.

419
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:14,562
[grunts]

420
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,104
[motivational music playing]

421
00:25:16,187 --> 00:25:18,604
[Genkai] I see determination on your face.

422
00:25:18,687 --> 00:25:20,271
[scoffs] That right?

423
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,687
Come on outside.

424
00:25:28,437 --> 00:25:29,896
[Botan] Hey! Hey!

425
00:25:34,062 --> 00:25:37,229
Your Spirit Energy has grown
since you started.

426
00:25:37,312 --> 00:25:39,604
I can feel that your heart is strong.

427
00:25:39,687 --> 00:25:42,229
Your foolish competitive streak
is what did it.

428
00:25:42,312 --> 00:25:43,896
Why is it foolish?

429
00:25:43,979 --> 00:25:46,896
It's foolish because
you're still wasting energy.

430
00:25:48,104 --> 00:25:50,937
Like a hose that's been
left running, full of water…

431
00:25:51,812 --> 00:25:56,562
You can condense your Spirit Energy
if you squeeze the end of the hose.

432
00:25:56,646 --> 00:25:57,937
Now practice.

433
00:25:58,021 --> 00:26:00,521
More crazy instructions today.

434
00:26:00,604 --> 00:26:01,771
It's not crazy.

435
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:05,604
There's a reason
that I had you stand on that spike.

436
00:26:06,312 --> 00:26:08,479
It was preparation for this.

437
00:26:11,146 --> 00:26:12,187
I see.

438
00:26:20,104 --> 00:26:22,104
[thrilling music playing]

439
00:26:23,812 --> 00:26:25,937
[energy whooshing]

440
00:26:26,021 --> 00:26:28,271
[wind whooshing]

441
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:30,396
Such strong energy!

442
00:26:33,521 --> 00:26:34,562
Yusuke!

443
00:26:35,187 --> 00:26:36,646
Almost there now!

444
00:26:38,312 --> 00:26:39,312
[exhales]

445
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:44,896
Let's do this.

446
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:46,937
[energy whooshing]

447
00:26:52,271 --> 00:26:53,146
[energy fires]

448
00:26:53,229 --> 00:26:54,812

[music ends]

450
00:27:17,896 --> 00:27:19,896
[sinister music playing]

451
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:29,396
I haven't seen that expression a while.

452
00:27:32,896 --> 00:27:34,229
Extraordinary.

453
00:27:35,312 --> 00:27:38,062
Something quite interesting is near.

454
00:27:38,146 --> 00:27:40,146
[laughing]

455
00:27:45,354 --> 00:27:46,646
[birds calling]

456
00:27:46,729 --> 00:27:48,729
[ominous music playing]

457
00:27:52,646 --> 00:27:53,937
[music fades]

458
00:28:02,396 --> 00:28:03,479
They know.

459
00:28:03,562 --> 00:28:05,562
[tense music playing]

460
00:28:07,146 --> 00:28:08,562
[breathing shakily]

461
00:28:13,146 --> 00:28:14,771
[grunting]

462
00:28:19,271 --> 00:28:20,187
[Yusuke exhales]

463
00:28:20,896 --> 00:28:21,729
[grunts softly]

464
00:28:21,812 --> 00:28:23,062
Master, what's wrong?

465
00:28:23,979 --> 00:28:25,229
[Genkai] Yusuke.

466
00:28:25,812 --> 00:28:27,479
I'm going to give you something.

467
00:28:30,521 --> 00:28:32,479
That desire to grow stronger.

468
00:28:33,396 --> 00:28:34,687
Do you still feel it?

469
00:28:36,396 --> 00:28:37,229
Yeah.

470
00:28:38,812 --> 00:28:40,271
I feel it all the time.

471
00:28:43,437 --> 00:28:47,104
Well, then I'm sure you'll become
even stronger in the future.

472
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:51,771
As you get older your skills will improve.

473
00:28:52,396 --> 00:28:54,229
Your tactics will mature also.

474
00:28:54,896 --> 00:28:58,937
And yet, all of us are aware
that the day will arrive

475
00:28:59,021 --> 00:29:02,312
when we can no longer resist
the power in front of us.

476
00:29:03,396 --> 00:29:05,604
And I've learned to accept that fact.

477
00:29:06,937 --> 00:29:08,437
Living with the flow

478
00:29:09,187 --> 00:29:10,187
and dying.

479
00:29:11,271 --> 00:29:14,229
We have to entrust our hopes
to the next generation.

480
00:29:15,146 --> 00:29:16,271
[Yusuke scoffs]

481
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:18,187
Is this another lesson?

482
00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:20,146
[Genkai] Just be quiet and listen.

483
00:29:20,896 --> 00:29:24,687
You must understand that sacrificing
what you value to gain power

484
00:29:24,771 --> 00:29:26,187
is not real strength.

485
00:29:27,021 --> 00:29:29,104
In reality, it is weakness of heart.

486
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:31,896
Remember that.

487
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,979
Now will you carry this wisdom with you?

488
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:37,479
[inspirational music playing]

489
00:29:41,021 --> 00:29:42,021
In all honesty…

490
00:29:44,354 --> 00:29:47,521
before all this started,
I don't think I would.

491
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:51,604
Something did occur to me, though.

492
00:29:53,812 --> 00:29:56,271
The world is counting on us to do this.

493
00:30:01,896 --> 00:30:03,396
As long as I'm alive,

494
00:30:05,146 --> 00:30:06,979
I will honor their trust.

495
00:30:09,062 --> 00:30:10,312
Yusuke, hear me,

496
00:30:10,979 --> 00:30:12,646
don't ever forget those words.

497
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:14,729
[music continues]

498
00:30:20,896 --> 00:30:22,771
[Genkai] This is the Spirit Wave Orb.

499
00:30:25,646 --> 00:30:26,896
It's yours.

500
00:30:27,437 --> 00:30:30,187
And you will carry it
inside of you as your secret.

501
00:30:33,104 --> 00:30:34,271
Take it.

502
00:30:34,354 --> 00:30:36,354
[inspirational music continues]

503
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:43,979
[music intensifies]

[music fades]

505
00:30:49,521 --> 00:30:51,979
The world needs you now more than ever.

506
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:58,021
Your training is hereby complete.

507
00:30:58,646 --> 00:31:00,229
You may leave this mountain.

508
00:31:01,104 --> 00:31:03,104
[dramatic music playing]

509
00:31:19,062 --> 00:31:20,812
We'll return for training soon!

510
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:23,604
Even if you're against it, all right?

511
00:31:25,604 --> 00:31:26,937
You two take care.

512
00:31:28,604 --> 00:31:29,729
[chuckles]

513
00:31:34,021 --> 00:31:35,271
[Kuwabara] Okay!

514
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,354
[music ends]

515
00:31:49,979 --> 00:31:51,979

[tense music playing]

523
00:32:47,021 --> 00:32:48,271
[thunder crashing]

524
00:32:49,979 --> 00:32:51,687
You've aged, Genkai.

525
00:32:53,687 --> 00:32:56,062
Looks like the years
have been kind to you.

526
00:32:56,146 --> 00:32:58,104
Just as I remember you 50 years ago.

527
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:02,479
You gave the Orb to that kid already?

528
00:33:04,437 --> 00:33:05,271
Yes.

529
00:33:06,687 --> 00:33:09,187
Then I sent him on his way. He's not here.

530
00:33:09,271 --> 00:33:11,979
In that case, I've no further use for you.

531
00:33:13,896 --> 00:33:14,896
No. [scoffs]

532
00:33:16,521 --> 00:33:19,896
Really, I can't bear to look at you
in your current state.

533
00:33:20,937 --> 00:33:22,396
[thunder rumbling]

534
00:33:25,021 --> 00:33:26,771
As this old woman.

535
00:33:27,896 --> 00:33:30,021
A truly depressing end.

536
00:33:31,396 --> 00:33:33,562
The feeling's mutual, I assure you.

537
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:36,354
So pathetic, selling your soul.

538
00:33:36,437 --> 00:33:39,437
And just because you want
to cling to your fleeting strength.

539
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,312
Then I'm afraid

540
00:33:44,729 --> 00:33:47,562
that one of us will have to go away.

541
00:33:47,646 --> 00:33:48,979
[inhales deeply]

542
00:33:49,896 --> 00:33:52,354
Well, you haven't changed, have you?

543
00:33:53,812 --> 00:33:55,896
You still care about fighting,

544
00:33:56,771 --> 00:33:58,479
and nothing else at all.

551
00:34:30,062 --> 00:34:33,229
Ugh. Yusuke, where have you been?
What's going on?

552
00:34:33,312 --> 00:34:35,937
Uh, Kuwabara and I
were at a training camp.

553
00:34:36,021 --> 00:34:37,437
Are you serious?

554
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:39,021
What do you mean training?

555
00:34:39,104 --> 00:34:40,604
You two are always fighting.

556
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:42,104
So what? There's a lot going on.

557
00:34:42,187 --> 00:34:44,437
[man] Keiko, please take the curtain down.

558
00:34:44,521 --> 00:34:45,396
Got it.

- [woman] Thank you, Yusuke!
- [man] Thank you. See you!

563
00:34:57,646 --> 00:34:59,812
[Keiko] I think it's great
that you guys get along now.

564
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:01,604
It's not like that. Got it?

565
00:35:01,687 --> 00:35:03,896
[Keiko] Huh? I don't get it.

566
00:35:06,937 --> 00:35:08,021
All right. See ya!

567
00:35:08,104 --> 00:35:10,146
You do need to go back
to school eventually, you know?

568
00:35:10,229 --> 00:35:11,312
Yeah, yeah.

[Yusuke] Give Keiko back.

625

Who the hell is Keiko?

626
00:38:40,854 --> 00:38:42,854
You know who she is, asshole!

[Kurama] The two of you
shouldn't be fighting.

Kurama?

632
00:39:01,896 --> 00:39:03,146
Don't get in my way!

633
00:39:03,229 --> 00:39:05,187
He wasn't the one who took your friend.

634
00:39:08,187 --> 00:39:09,562
Yeah, like hell.

635
00:39:10,146 --> 00:39:11,646
I saw you kidnap her.

636
00:39:13,729 --> 00:39:15,396
You two have fun together.

637
00:39:17,729 --> 00:39:19,729
I found out where your sister is.

638
00:39:23,479 --> 00:39:24,937
[pensive music playing]

- [computer beeps]
- [door opens]

641
00:39:51,562 --> 00:39:53,604
This is what you found so interesting?

642
00:39:54,104 --> 00:39:55,021
Yes.

643
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:56,687
For my brother's sake,

644
00:39:56,771 --> 00:39:59,604
I thought I'd make it
a real welcome party.

645
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:01,396
Well then,

646
00:40:01,896 --> 00:40:03,979
we'll extend a cordial invitation.

647
00:40:11,229 --> 00:40:14,646
[Yusuke] So you're telling me
that Keiko and his younger sister

648
00:40:14,729 --> 00:40:16,979
are being held hostage in the same place?

649
00:40:17,604 --> 00:40:18,604
Looks like it.

650
00:40:19,646 --> 00:40:20,937
What could be the reason?

651
00:40:23,229 --> 00:40:26,354
I have some idea
why Hiei's younger sister was kidnapped.

652
00:40:27,354 --> 00:40:28,646
That said,

653
00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:31,104
I'm not sure
why your girlfriend was taken.

654
00:40:31,604 --> 00:40:33,062
She's not my girlfriend.

655
00:40:33,146 --> 00:40:34,062
Does it matter?

656
00:40:34,146 --> 00:40:35,729
Huh? How about you shut it?

657
00:40:37,562 --> 00:40:38,854
Hey, listen to me.

658
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:43,937
It's likely that we're playing right
into their hands if we rush in there.

659
00:40:45,187 --> 00:40:48,312
This is far too well orchestrated
if all they wanted was her.

660
00:40:52,021 --> 00:40:53,187
That's just fine.

661
00:40:54,854 --> 00:40:57,854
If we act on their invitation,
it'll lead us to Keiko.

662
00:41:00,062 --> 00:41:01,146
[sighs]

663
00:41:01,229 --> 00:41:02,146
Lead the way.

664
00:41:03,937 --> 00:41:04,854
[Hiei sighs]

665
00:41:07,562 --> 00:41:08,437
Hiei.

666
00:41:11,646 --> 00:41:13,896
Sorry, I shouldn't have
attacked you earlier.

667
00:41:17,562 --> 00:41:18,687
Let's go together.

668
00:41:20,146 --> 00:41:21,729
Come on. Let's get your sister.

669
00:41:23,354 --> 00:41:24,354
[Hiei sighs]

670
00:41:26,687 --> 00:41:28,854
[Kurama] I'll take you
to Kubikukuri Island.

[sinister music playing]

672
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:40,146
Urameshi!

673
00:41:41,104 --> 00:41:42,312
[Yusuke] Kuwabara?

674
00:41:42,396 --> 00:41:45,146
You bastard!
You trying to keep me out of this?

675
00:41:45,896 --> 00:41:47,604
You're gonna save Yukimura, right?

676
00:41:48,396 --> 00:41:51,646
- Yeah.
- Well, then I'm going too, obviously.

677
00:41:51,729 --> 00:41:53,062
[Hiei] Who the hell are you?

678
00:41:53,146 --> 00:41:54,187
You wanna die?

679
00:41:54,271 --> 00:41:55,687
Say that again.

680
00:41:55,771 --> 00:41:58,271
I think a little guy like you
should learn to keep his mouth shut.

681
00:41:58,354 --> 00:41:59,604
[Yusuke] Hey, cut it out.

682
00:42:00,146 --> 00:42:01,562
Hiei's with us.

683
00:42:01,646 --> 00:42:02,687
No, I'm not.

684
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:04,271
'Course you're not, jackass.

685
00:42:04,771 --> 00:42:07,521
I'm not gonna partner
with an idiot like you.

686
00:42:08,104 --> 00:42:09,396
You bastard!

687
00:42:09,479 --> 00:42:12,854
Wow, this asshole sure knows how
to make a first impression!

688
00:42:21,312 --> 00:42:22,896
[man] We've been expecting you.

689
00:42:23,396 --> 00:42:27,146
The boss has requested that
I invite you all to Kubikukuri Island.
